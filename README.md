# COP4331BigProjectSummer2018

This is a class project for COP 4331 - Processes of Object Oriented Programming Class. Our team is creating a Rock, Paper, Scissor app that will allow users to compete against each other via web interface. The results will be displayed on the webpage while the users will enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissor) on the app. A demonstration video is under progress and will be uploaded soon.
