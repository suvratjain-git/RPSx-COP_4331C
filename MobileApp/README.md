# RockPaperScissorApp
This is a class project. The app is imitating the game of Rock-Paper-Scissor. Essentially, two users enter a lobby where the system randomly assigns them a game session. 
The users then compete against each other by entering their option (i.e. Rock, Paper, or Scissor) on the app and sending it to the webpage. The webpage recieves the commands, displays which user won, and allocates the points accordingly. The winner is selected based on best 2 out of 3 basis.
